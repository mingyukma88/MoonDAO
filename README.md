# MoonDAO - a fully fledged DAO sending people to the moon!!

### MoonDAO is all about going to the moon**
The whole DAO is built with javascript, React and thirdweb SDK:

1. Built the webapp dashboard in React and tested on Replit and the Etheruem Rinkeby Testnet. 
2. Run multiple scripts using thridweb sdk and leveraged Alchemy to boardcast transaction, and metamask for reading/writing transactions
3. Created ERC-1155 contract for multiple people to mint the same NFT
      - Used bundleDrop Module to store metadata
      - Set Claim conditions for the time to mint NFT as well as maximum number of minted NFT
4. Deployed ERC-20 contract to create MOON token and airdropped tokens to myself
5. Deployed governance contract and treasury using scripts written in voteModule from thridwebsdk 
6. Built a dapp that lets people connect their wallet, get an NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that are executed directly by your governance contract.
